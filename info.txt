I will generate a short animation depicting a cat exploring space in five distinct scenes.

Scene 1: A ginger tabby cat wearing a small astronaut helmet floats inside a spaceship cockpit, looking out at a vibrant nebula filled with swirling purple and pink clouds.

Scene 2: The cat is now outside the spaceship, gently bouncing off a large, grey asteroid with its paws extended, a backdrop of distant, sparkling stars visible.

Scene 3: The cat is seen playfully chasing a small, glowing space butterfly with iridescent wings near a field of colorful, floating space crystals.

Scene 4: The cat is curled up asleep on a crescent moon, a serene blue planet hanging in the dark sky behind it.

Scene 5: The cat is back inside the spaceship, now looking at Earth through a large window, a contented expression on its face.
